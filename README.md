# fhdfixer
Screen resolution changing made easy.

This script was created in order to deal with screen problems in certain monitors, as well as to prevent changes in resolution or missing xrandr profiles.

It comes in two different versions: the first one is intended to be executed as an init script, just modify the code variables to your specifications and make it do its work. The second one, 'fhdfixer-uf', standing the 'uf' for 'user-friendly' is a more easy to use, casual users oriented version of the same script. When called from a command line, a simple, 'wizardish' script will ask the user for the desired resolution. Once it finishes, the script will change the resolution instantly.

Note that the project name is 'fhdfixer', but this is NOT only for FullHD resolutions. It was just the first name I came with.
